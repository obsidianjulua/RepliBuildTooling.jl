# CMakeHarvest.jl — build-system introspection for upstream CMake projects
#
# RepliBuild compiles all-sources-minus-excludes under ONE uniform flag set and
# never runs a configure step. That rules out every library whose headers are
# produced by feature detection (`configure_file` over a `config.h.in`) — the
# build cannot even start. libcurl was the first exception, unblocked by hand:
# run cmake once, copy `lib/curl_config.h` into the package, check it in (see
# packages/curl/config/README.md in the Hub).
#
# This module generalises that one-off. cmake's **configure** step is not its
# build step: it is a self-contained feature-detection pass that emits the
# generated headers and, with CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS, a full record of
# how upstream intends to compile every translation unit. Both are harvestable
# in seconds without a compiler ever touching a real source file.
#
# So this reads a build system rather than running one, and yields three things:
#
#   1. the generated headers (and configure-time generated sources) to check in,
#   2. the exact -D / -I set upstream uses, for [compile],
#   3. a mechanical answer to the Hub's admission question — "does every source
#      compile under one flag set?" — from compile_commands.json instead of by
#      eye, plus the exclude list implied by the files a target never compiles.
#
# What it does NOT do: run a build. Libraries that defer generation to a build
# rule (libpng's pnglibconf.h comes out of an awk pipeline wired as a custom
# command) yield nothing here — `generated_headers` comes back empty, which is
# the honest signal to look for a shipped fallback or reach for `ingest()`.

"""
    CMakeTarget

One cmake library target and the flags it compiles its sources under.

# Fields
- `name::String` — cmake target name (e.g. `pcre2-8-shared`)
- `kind::Symbol` — `:shared` or `:static`, inferred from the defines
- `files::Vector{String}` — its TUs, source-relative (generated ones config-relative)
- `defines::Vector{String}` — `-D` flags
- `include_dirs::Vector{String}` — `-I` dirs, package-relative where possible
- `flag_sets::Int` — distinct flag sets *within* this target; 1 is the healthy case

`kind` is read off `<target>_EXPORTS`, which cmake defines only when building a
shared or module library — a more reliable tell than the target's name, but only
a heuristic: a project that rolls its own visibility switch instead of using
cmake's (libyaml's `YAML_DECLARE_EXPORT`) reads as `:static` even when
`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` produced it. The label is advisory; it only decides which
target [`main_target`](@ref) prefers when a project configures several, and a
single-target project is picked correctly either way.

"""
    CMakeProbe

The result of a configure-only cmake run over an upstream source tree.

# Fields
- `name::String` — project name (defaults to the source directory's basename)
- `source_dir::String` — the upstream checkout that was probed
- `build_dir::String` — scratch build tree cmake configured into
- `cmake_args::Vector{String}` — the arguments the probe was run with
- `generated_headers::Vector{String}` — build-dir-relative generated headers
- `generated_sources::Vector{String}` — build-dir-relative generated `.c`/`.cpp`
- `targets::Vector{CMakeTarget}` — every library target cmake configured
- `tree_sources::Vector{String}` — every `.c`/`.cpp` in the checkout
- `cmake_version::String`
- `probed_at::DateTime`

A project routinely configures the *same* sources into several targets — shared,
static, and a compat shim is the common trio. That is not per-file flag
divergence and must not be read as one, so uniformity is judged per target (see
[`uniform`](@ref)) and [`main_target`](@ref) picks the one to build from.

on [`main_target`](@ref); other targets may still diverge, which is fine, since
only one target is ever built.

                config_rel="config", clone_rel="", use_llvm_env=true) -> CMakeProbe

Run cmake's **configure** step over `source_dir` and read back what it generated
and how it intends to compile. No build is run and no compiler touches a real
source file; the cost is the feature-detection pass alone (single-digit seconds
for every library tried so far).

`args` are extra `-D` arguments — the place to turn off tests, tools, examples
and optional dependencies. Keeping that set lean is the whole game: a default
configure of libcurl enables brotli, zstd, nghttp2, idn2, psl, libssh2, c-ares
and krb5, and every one becomes a link library that can break `use(...)` on its
next bump.

Keyword notes:
- `shared` adds `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`, matching `[binary] type = "shared"`.
  Projects with their own `FOO_SHARED`/`FOO_STATIC` switches usually configure
  both target kinds anyway; that is expected, and `main_target` picks the shared
  one rather than mistaking it for flag divergence.
- `policy_floor` adds `-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`. cmake 4.x refuses a
  `cmake_minimum_required` below 3.5 outright, a configure-time hard error on
  plenty of still-current releases (libyaml 0.2.5, for one).
- `clone_rel` is where the checkout will live relative to the package dir, used
  to render include paths for the TOML — for a `[dependencies]` git clone that
  is `.replibuild_cache/deps/<dep-name>`.
- `use_llvm_env` runs cmake under RepliBuild's LLVM environment, so the feature
  probes are answered by the same clang that will compile the sources. This is
  the one place the harvest improves on doing it by hand: a header captured from
  the system compiler can disagree with the toolchain that consumes it.

The probe is read-only with respect to `source_dir`.

Render the probe as `replibuild.toml` fragments for one target — `[compile]`
flags and include dirs from what upstream actually passes, plus the `exclude`
list implied by the sources that target never compiles.

This is a **proposal, not a manifest**. It is the structural half only; the
residue half (`[wrap.varargs]`, `[wrap.macros]`) cannot come from a build system,
because it is precisely what the preprocessor erased before the build system
ever saw it. Those entries are still earned one at a time from wrap failures.

Read every line before pasting. In particular decide, per library, what to do
with the defines that describe cmake's build rather than the library: `NDEBUG`
is usually noise, but `<target>_EXPORTS` may be load-bearing for symbol
visibility, and dropping it can empty the dynamic symbol table.
